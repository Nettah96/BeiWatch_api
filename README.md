# BeiWatch

BeiWatch is a local price intelligence project focused on tracking, analyzing, and understanding everyday market prices in real communities.

The goal of BeiWatch is simple. Make local price data visible, reliable, and useful.

This repository contains Bash based ingestion scripts that simulate how real world price data can be collected and sent to an API for analysis.

## Why BeiWatch Exists

In many local markets, prices change daily but reliable data is hard to find. Consumers guess. Traders rely on word of mouth. Researchers struggle with outdated averages.

BeiWatch is designed to solve that gap by creating a clean pipeline for local price data collection and future analysis.

This project treats price data as infrastructure, not just numbers.
